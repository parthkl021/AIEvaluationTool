# Docker Run

The Docker workflow provides a containerized way to run the AI Evaluation Tool stack without setting up each service manually on the host.

## What Docker Adds

Docker packages the main evaluation services into a reproducible environment. This makes it easier to start the database, browser automation layer, interface layer, and CLI runtime in a consistent way across machines.

## Core Services In The Stack

The Docker setup centers around these services:

- `db` for MariaDB
- `selenium-browser` for browser automation and live browser viewing
- `interface-manager` for target interaction
- `auth-service`, `app-backend`, `app-front-end`, `tdms-backend`, `tdms-frontend`
- `nginx` as the single public entrypoint

CLI tasks (import, execution, analysis, reporting) are run through `app-backend`.

## Typical Docker Workflow

At a high level, the Docker workflow looks like this:

1. Prepare `.env` and repository configuration files.
2. Build the Docker images.
3. Start the stack through `nginx`.
4. Make Ollama and Sarvam AI reachable from the containerized CLI flow.
5. Run importer, testcase execution, analysis, and report commands with `docker compose run ... app-backend`.

This makes Docker a good option when you want a reproducible environment for local development, shared setup across teammates, or cleaner service orchestration.

## GPU And Model Serving

The Docker setup is designed to work with both local and remote model-serving patterns. In practice, Docker is mainly used to containerize the evaluation services, while Ollama and Sarvam AI can be hosted either on the same machine or on a remote GPU machine and exposed through environment variables.

## When To Use This Path

Docker is a strong choice when:

- you want a repeatable environment
- you want to avoid manual service-by-service installation
- you need Selenium, MariaDB, Interface Manager, and the CLI to work together consistently
- you want to keep the execution workflow closer to production-like service boundaries
