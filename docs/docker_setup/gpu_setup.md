# GPU Setup

This page documents the Docker-oriented GPU setup patterns for the AI Evaluation Tool.

The key goal is to make both of these endpoints reachable from Dockerized runtime containers (`app-backend` and related services):

- `OLLAMA_URL`
- `GPU_URL`

Once both endpoints are reachable from inside Docker, the rest of the pipeline stays the same.

## Required Models

The README identifies these primary models for the LLM-as-judge and supporting evaluation flow:

1. `sarvamai/sarvam-2b-v0.5`
2. `google/shieldgemma-2b`
3. `sarvamai/sarvam-translate`
4. `qwen3:32b`

## Local GPU Setup

Use this setup when the Docker machine and the GPU machine are the same host.

This is the simplest arrangement: Ollama runs on the host and Sarvam AI can either run as a Compose profile or as another reachable endpoint.

### Serve Ollama On The Host

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:32b
ollama serve
```

### Option A: Use Compose-Managed Sarvam AI (Recommended)

```bash
docker compose --profile sarvam up -d sarvam-ai
```

Then set in `.env`:

```env
GPU_URL="http://sarvam-ai:16000/"
```

### Option B: Use Host-Served Sarvam Endpoint

If Sarvam is running on the Docker host directly, use:

```env
GPU_URL="http://host.docker.internal:16000/"
```

### Set Common `.env` Model Values

```env
OLLAMA_URL="http://host.docker.internal:11434/"
LLM_AS_JUDGE_MODEL="qwen3:32b"
SARVAM_API_KEY=""
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
```

## Remote GPU Setup

Use this setup when evaluation commands are run locally, but the actual model serving happens on a separate GPU host.

### Serve Ollama On The Remote GPU Machine

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:32b
ollama serve
```

Sarvam AI should also be running on that remote GPU host and exposed on port `16000`.

### Forward The Remote Ports To The Local Machine

From your local machine, create SSH tunnels to both the Ollama port and the Sarvam AI port:

```bash
ssh <user>@<remote-gpu-host> \
  -L 21434:localhost:11434 \
  -L 16000:localhost:16000
```

Once those tunnels are active, the forwarded ports behave like local host ports from Docker’s point of view.

### Point Local Docker Containers To The Forwarded Ports

Set in `.env`:

```env
OLLAMA_URL="http://host.docker.internal:21434/"
GPU_URL="http://host.docker.internal:16000/"
LLM_AS_JUDGE_MODEL="qwen3:32b"
SARVAM_API_KEY=""
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
```

## Notes On Reachability

- `OLLAMA_URL` is used by LLM-as-judge and related local-LLM strategies.
- `GPU_URL` is used by strategy modules that call the Sarvam AI or GPU inference API.
- both endpoints must be reachable from inside Docker containers

If either endpoint is wrong, the workflow usually fails later during execution or analysis, so this is a good place to validate connectivity early.

## Additional Models Downloaded During Runtime

The README also notes that these smaller models may be downloaded during execution:

- `amedvedev/bert-tiny-cognitive-bias`
- `LibrAI/longformer-harmful-ro`
- `vectara/hallucination_evaluation_model`
- `thenlper/gte-small`
- `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- `nicholasKluge/ToxiGuardrail`
- `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2`
- `google/flan-t5-large`
- `holistic-ai/bias_classifier_albertv2`
- `Human-CentricAI/LLM-Refusal-Classifier`
- `cross-encoder/nli-deberta-base`

## Validation Checklist

- Ollama is reachable
- Sarvam AI is reachable
- `.env` values match the actual ports
- SSH tunneling is active for remote setups
- Docker services can resolve `host.docker.internal`
