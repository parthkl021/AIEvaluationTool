## Key Features and Evaluation Dimensions:

- **Responsible AI**: Assesses the ethical and safe behavior of the AI, including toxicity detection and guardrail enforcement.

- **Conversational Quality**: Measures the fluency, coherence, and appropriateness of responses using advanced linguistic metrics and human-like judgment.

- **Guardrails and Safety**: Evaluates the AI's ability to avoid generating unsafe, toxic, or inappropriate content, and to comply with predefined safety and ethics.

- **Language Support**: Evaluates the model's ability to understand and generate text in multiple languages, including coverage and similarity metrics.

- **Task Understanding**: Tests the AI's ability to comprehend and execute user instructions accurately.

- **Performance and Scalability**: Assesses the system’s speed, reliability, and stability through performance and scalability metrics.

- **Privacy and Security**: Assesses the system’s ability to safeguard sensitive information, maintain user trust, and resist misuse or adversarial manipulation while ensuring balanced and responsible handling of safety constraints.

## How It Works:

- **Test Case Execution**: A mechanism to send a diverse set of prompts to the conversational AI, simulating real user interactions across different platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, web interfaces).

- **Response Analysis**: Applies a suite of custom and standard evaluation strategies—including text similarity, grammar checking, toxicity analysis, and more—to each response.

- **Metric Aggregation**: Aggregates results into comprehensive reports, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement across all tested dimensions.

## Setup Guide

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cerai-iitm/AIEvaluationTool
cd AIEvaluationTool
```

---

### 2. **Install Prerequisites**

Before installing Python dependencies, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Google Chrome Browser**
- **ChromeDriver** (must match your Chrome version; this is a mandatory install for interface automation)
- **MariaDB Server**

---

### 3. **Install Python Dependencies**

Install all dependencies for each component using the provided `requirements.txt` files:

```bash
# For installing dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

### 4. **Setting up the XPath and Credentials of the Accounts**

This section explains how to configure XPath locators for web elements and securely store account credentials required for automated testing or web scraping. Proper setup ensures that your scripts interact with the correct UI elements and authenticate successfully.

### 4.1 **Adding XPath Locators**

XPath locators are used by automation frameworks (e.g., Selenium) to identify and interact with web elements.

- Locate the element in the web application (e.g., username field, password field, login button, prompt textbox and response element's xpath).
    - Right-click on the element → Inspect → Copy XPath.
    - Prefer relative XPath over absolute to avoid breakage when the DOM structure changes.
- Update the configuration file (`xpaths.json`).


``` json
{
  "applications": {
    "app_name_here": {
      "LoginPage": {
        "email_input": "xpath_for_email_input",
        "password_input": "xpath_for_password_input",
        "login_button": "xpath_for_login_button"
      },
      "LogoutPage": {
        "profile": "xpath_for_profile_icon",
        "logout_button": "xpath_for_logout_button"
      },
      "ChatPage": {
        "contact_search": "xpath_for_contact_search",
        "prompt_input": "xpath_for_prompt_input",
        "agent_response": "xpath_for_agent_response",
        "message_in": "xpath_for_incoming_message",
        "message_out": "xpath_for_outgoing_message"
      },
      "OtherPages": {
        "custom_element_1": "xpath_for_custom_element",
        "custom_element_2": "xpath_for_custom_element"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Storing Account Credentials

To keep credentials secure and maintainable, here is the template of the `credentials.json`

```json
{
  "applications":
  {
    "cpgrams": {
      "username": "user_cpgrams",
      "password": "pass_cpgrams"
    },
    "openweb-ui": {
      "username": "user_openweb_ui",
      "password": "pass_openweb_ui"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 4. **Model Setup for LLM-based Evaluation**

To use the LLM-as-a-judge mechanism for evaluation, you must have a language model available. You can either:
- **Run a model locally** (e.g., using Ollama, OpenAI-compatible local models, etc.), or
- **Provide API keys** for cloud-based models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

**Supported Models:**
- OpenAI GPT-3.5/4 (via API key)
- Anthropic Claude (via API key)
- Ollama (local)
- Any OpenAI-compatible local model

**Configuration:**
- Ensure that `.env.example` in the root folder is initialized with appropriate values to create a `.env` file.
- `OLLAMA_URL` points to the installed Ollama instance's endpoint address.  Typically it is `http://localhost:11434/`
- `LLM_AS_JUDGE_MODEL` points to the name of the LLM (loaded via Ollama) that we want to use as a judge.  Typically, it is `llama3.1:70b`.
- `PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY` should have the API KEY of Perspective service for toxicity detection.
- `GPU_URL` should point to the Sarvam AI RestAPI server (./src/app/sarvam_ai/) hosted elsewhere.  Typically, the URL is `http://localhost:8000`.
- For API-based models, set your API key in a `.env` file or as an environment variable (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).
- For local models, ensure the model server is running and accessible at the expected endpoint (see your model provider's documentation).

Ensure your model is accessible and properly configured before running the evaluation pipeline. Refer to the relevant documentation for your chosen model provider for setup instructions.

### 5. **Prepare Data Files**

Ensure the `data/` directory contains the following files (already present in the repository):
- `DataPoints.json` (sample test dataset)
- `plans.json`
- `strategy_map.json`
- `strategy_id.json`
- `metric_strategy_mapping.json`
- **A detailed set of Seeding data points shall be provided upon request.**



## Running the Evaluation Pipeline

**Step 1: Import datapoints into Database**

Create a database in the MariaDB server and authorize a database user with full privileges.  Replace the host, port number, username, password, and database name in the `config.json` file. 

Open a terminal on your machine and run:

```bash
python3 src/app/importer/main.py --config "path to the config file"
```

After running the importer script, the terminal shows the following outputs.

![Importing datapoints to database](screenshots/importing%20data%20to%20database.png)

**Step 2: Start the InterfaceManager API Service**

Open a terminal on your machine and run:
```bash
cd src/app/interface_manager
python main.py
```

#### API Server Running

After starting the InterfaceManager API Service, the terminal shows the following outputs.

![Interface Server Running](screenshots/interface_manager_running.png)

**Step 3: Run the Test Case Execution Manager**

Replace the host, port number, username, password, and database name in the `config.json` file. Open another new terminal on your machine and run to see what options are available in testcase executor:

```bash
cd src/app/testcase_executor
python main.py --config "path to config file" -h
```

![Arguments available in Testcase Executor](screenshots/arguments%20of%20testcase%20executor.png)

![Plans](screenshots/get_plans.png)

![Metrics](screenshots/get_metrics.png)


To run the Testcase execution, run the following command:

```bash
cd src/app/testcase_executor
python main.py --testplan-id <testplan-id> --testcase-id <testcase-id> --metric-id <metric-id> --max-testcases <max-testcases>  --config "path to config file" --execute 
```
*(Adjust `--testplan-id`, `--testcase-id`, `--metric-id`, `--max-testcases` and  as needed.)*

#### Test Case Execution Manager Running
On running the Test Case Execution Manager, the terminal output should look similar to:

![TEM Running](screenshots/Testcase_execution_manager_running.png)

The Test Case Execution Manager leverages the interface automation to automatically deliver test cases to the conversational platform and retrieve responses without manual intervention.

![Interface](screenshots/Interface.jpg)


This step will execute the test cases and store the responses in `data/responses.json`.

**Step 4: Run the LLMS in your GPUs**

In order for the evaluation framework to work we need to have 4 models to be in place - 

1. sarvamai/sarvam-2b-v0.5
2. google/shieldgemma-2b
3. sarvamai/sarvam-translate
4. mistral:7b-instruct (Default LLM as Judge)

```bash
cd src/app/sarvam_ai
python main.py
```

You need to port forward to facilitate the model to connect to your testing machine. You can use the command below -

```bash
ollama run mistral:7b-instruct
ssh gpu_machine_cred@machineIP -L testing_machine_ip:11434:localhost:11434 -L testing_machine_ip:8000:localhost:8000
```

Here in 11434 the LLM as Judge Model ie mistral:7b-instruct is hosted through ollama and 8000 is used to serve the other 3 models.

There are other small sized models which gets downloaded while running this application. The models are - 

1. amedvedev/bert-tiny-cognitive-bias
2. NousResearch/Minos-v1
3. LibrAI/longformer-harmful-ro
4. vectara/hallucination_evaluation_model
5. thenlper/gte-small
6. all-MiniLM-L6-v2
7. facebook/bart-large-cnn
8. nicholasKluge/ToxiGuardrail
9. paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2

**Step 5: Run the Response Analyzer**

**Once the previous step has completed and `responses.json` is populated**, open a new terminal and run:

```bash
cd src/app/response_analyzer
python analyze.py --config "path to config file" --run-name <run-name>
```

*(Adjust `--run-name` as needed.)*

> **Note:** If you are using a local model (e.g., Ollama or any OpenAI-compatible local model), ensure that the model server is running in the background and accessible before executing the Response Analyzer.

#### Response Analyzer Running

## Results

The Response Analyzer block when executed will display a detailed report on the terminal, showing scores evaluated for metrics under the test plan and can be used as an indicator of the validity of the model against a particular metric.

**To see the evaluation report**, open a new terminal and run:

```bash
cd src/app/response_analyzer
python report.py --config "path to config file" --run-name <run-name>
```

*(Use the same run-name used in analysis step.)*

#### Evaluation Report
A sample evaluation report generated by the Response Analyzer can be seen below:
